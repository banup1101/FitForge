By clicking on the menu, the user is able to access the different parts of our web application.

LOGIN/REGISTER:
The register page will have the user fill out 3 fields; Username, Password and Email. The user will be required to enter a username which can be anything they like. The password will require the user to input a 6 character password. If the password does not meet the requirement, the webpage will display "Oopsie something broke:". The email will require the user to input a valid email (i.e. an email followed by @emailhere.com). Upon the user meeting all these requirements, the application will display "Data Added Successfully!" and be redirected to the login page where they will be able to input the user information they have just created.
